# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

# If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.

# React-Todo-App

Description:-
A clean, minimal, and responsive ToDo List application built with React.js. This app helps users keep track of daily tasks with features like marking tasks as done and saving them in local storage so they don't disappear on refresh.

🔧 Key Features:-
➕ Add new tasks to your list

✅ Mark tasks as done using a checkbox

❌ Delete completed or unwanted tasks

📱 Fully responsive design – works on mobile and desktop

⚛️ Uses React hooks (useState) for real-time updates
💾 Persistent data using Local Storage – tasks remain saved even after refreshing the browser

📌 How It Works:-
Type a task in the input field and click "Add"

Each task has a checkbox – tick it to mark as completed

Completed tasks can be deleted (optional)
